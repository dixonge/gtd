So much more than the show!

Of course I read the book while picturing all of the actors from the series, those I could identify. But the true story behind the show is so much better! I found it both more informative and more hopeful. I think the main takeaway was a keen insight to just how broken the women's prison system is, and I can't imagine the men's being any better. Legalize the drugs, and completely separate non-violent offenders. That seems like it would be a good place to start!
