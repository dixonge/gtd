So my previous post was pretty positive. And then I tried to consolidate users and locked myself out.

So I spent a lot of time installing a postgresql editor and trying out different password changes. None of them worked. So I uninstalled everything and reinstalled it. But the install script kept finding something that made it think it was already installed, so it just stopped.

HOURS. I lost hours. I finally gave up and uninstalled every scrap of PostgreSQL I could find, and my restyaboard files, and just went back to Trello. Yeah, not on my own server, I get it. But there's a limit to my patience, and I won't get those hours back either.
