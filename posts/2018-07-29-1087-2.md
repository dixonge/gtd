Just a quick note to my new 'community' on micro.blog - my feed might make it seem like I spent the last several months doing nothing but making posts about books I've read. In fact, I just imported my GoodReads into WordPress in draft status. The post dates were all matched to the date I originally finished the books, but when I set them all to 'published' WordPress decided that the dates should be reset to the day I published them. And the dates aren't available for recovery in the revisions. Eventually I'll hopefully find a way to fix that, but in the meantime my original actual articles etc. have been pushed about 130 posts back in the timeline. So that's what's going on, just FYI. ðŸ™‚
