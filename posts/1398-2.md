even though I have IndieWeb things basically working with this site, even after switching from WordPress to ClassicPress, I really want to switch the site to Hugo. And now I think I can do that while still keeping the IndieWeb things! Will take time, but looking forward to it, especially if it will run on Netlify and help me escape the tyranny of paid hosting!
