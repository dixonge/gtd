I'll write up the details later, but this site is now being created/parsed/compiled, etc. using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I'm still pushing it to GitHub, and Netlify is grabbing it and serving it. That part's the same. Just different under the hood. Also a new design/theme, and redoing IndieWeb.

More soon.
