This is an experiment. I want to see if I can use Twitter to replace either comment systems and/or webmentions. First, here is a raw link to a tweet:

https://twitter.com/realglenndixon/status/1228662878649147393?s=21

Yep, just a link. Evidently, if you want to *embed* a tweet, you have to actually go to the Twitter.com website. That's just strange! Here is the result of the messy embed code they give you:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a test. Feel free to ignore.</p>&mdash; The Realest (@realglenndixon) <a href="https://twitter.com/realglenndixon/status/1228662878649147393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

at least that part looks about right, BUT...no way to easily replace comments with Twitter. Oh well...
