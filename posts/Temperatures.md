This is perhaps too large a topic for one blog post. I have just finished reading *dozens* of articles on this topic. Even after correcting for possible motive/bias issues, and after weeding out ad hominems, I am left with the following conclusions:

1. The temperature dataset from 1850-1906 or so covers less than 50% of the globe.

2. The Southern hemisphere data coverage reached 50% only in 1950.

3. Global averages for a century were created by combining the sparse Northern hemisphere averages with the almost non-existent Southern hemisphere averages[^1]

4. Making any claim about current global temperature trends compared to the past is rendered meaningless.

5. In 1987 NOAA commissioned a study. It showed no warming trend in the U.S. from 1895-1987[^2]

6. It is perfectly safe to say that the earth has been warming since the end of the last ice age.

7. It is *not* perfectly safe to say that the last century contains a signature to prove accelerated temperature rises are occurring, or that they are anthropogenic.

8. It is not safe to conclude that CO2 at .0415% of the atmosphere is significant of anything.

9. It is not safe to conclude that CO2's correllation with temperature is consistent historically, or predictive.

10. It is also not safe to say that any climate model can possibly handle the complexity of forecasting future global temperature averages based on CO2 levels.

> Since the greenhouse effect of CO2 declines per unit as the total amount increases (diminishing returns), the expected increase in temperature from growing CO2 emissions by the end of this century is less than 1 ‚Å∞K (C).
