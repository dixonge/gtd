I've been blogging since around 1998 when I bought my first domain name (thedixons.net) and a book on Active Server Pages. Using the book, I handcrafted my own site using html, vbscript and a web host running Microsoft IIS server. It used MS Access for the database. At some point I switched to WordPress and became familiar with MySQL and PHP. Over the years I've used miscellaneous domain names, as well as various static site generators and CMS', including Jekyll, Hugo, Kirby, and Grav. The current iteration, as a subdomain, is relatively new, as is my current SSG, Eleventy.
