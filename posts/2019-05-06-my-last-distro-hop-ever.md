I know - I shouldn't say silly things like that. But really, I'm getting close to setting a record here.

<!-- excerpt -->
Again, the reasons for changing distros eludes me. Something about Lubuntu became problematic, but I don't remember what. I think I even switched to regular Ubuntu for awhile, but eventually landed on [Linux Mint 19][1]. I'm now using that on both laptop and desktop. And when I got my new desktop box (a little [Zotac Zbox][2]) I moved the drive over and even _it_ just worked, no futzing around with drivers at all!
