Regardless the accuracy of the often stated '97%' scientific consensus on climate change, I think it is safe to say that most climate scientists believe that anthropogenic CO2 is warming the earth faster than it would otherwise warm. The general public is more divided. A core of conservatives disagree on whether or not the earth is even warming at all, but most skeptics merely disagree on either the anthropogenic cause or the degree of the influence. Most all skeptics disagree on the severity of the future impact and political solutions.

Google seems determined to keep me trapped in the bubble I created since 2005 or so. The have demoted much of the skeptic sites in their search results. It's easy to feel alone as a skeptic. But at least I'm not the only one to have moved from alarmism to skepticism. Some interesting  examples:

On a related note, it just dawned on me how much the climate alarmists treat all dissent like religion does. Headlines like "how to talk to a climate skeptic" are *exactly* the same as religion treats agnostics and atheists. Questions like this drip with presumptuousness and arrogance and condescension! 

Rick Ross has long run a site about cults. From my perspective, most of his 'warning signs' apply to almost all religion, but it's a good starting point for comparison. Here's how I feel like some of them apply to climate alarmism (hell, I probably should have based this series on this list!):

1. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry. (to question is to deny - 'the science is settled')
2. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions. (apocalypse has been impending for four decades now!)
3. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil. (see Richard Tol)
4. Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances. (see Richard Lindzen, Nils-Axel Morner, Peter Ridd, et.)
5. Followers feel they can never be "good enough". (consume less, fly less, eat less)
6. The group/leader is always right. (any 'change' in climate or weather can be laid at the feet of global warming - which is much easier if you shift all terminology to 'climate change' or 'climate emergency' instead of warming)
