Many milestones that have come and gone in the last couple of years:

* We had to move back to Texas
  
* I had to go back to work
  
* We had to move to Austin
  
* I vested in my pension

One future milestone is when my wife officially retires (legally, as in receives a pension -- not just stops working, which actually happened in 2011). But mostly I have just been counting down the days. Last year. Last month.

And today I officially started my last pay period. The last day of this two-week period will be my last day at work. If all goes as planned, it will be my last wage-earning W2 type of job, ever!

It's starting to feel real now.
