Decided I wanted to 'own my data' when it came to projects. Needed to replicate Trello.

1 - installed Wekan. Easy peasy. Snap install. Imported Trello boards. All good.

2 - installed Restyaboard. Install script. Had to make a few decisions that I wasn't sure about. Took 10-15 minutes. Imported Trello boards. All good.

There is really only one reason I'm going to go with Restyaboard. It may seem silly, but it's the background images. Unavailable in Wekan.
