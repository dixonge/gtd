well then. So the Sunlit app posts stories to my default post-kind (which is set to notes) not to the pics kind. OwnYourGram imports from Instagram into pics. That's the preferred setup. Unfortunately OwnYourGram isn't functioning (that I can tell) or operates on an extreme delay. Sunlit works immediately, just not as an Instagram replacement exactly.
