Just throwing out some thoughts on what I really want in a blog:

  * Cross-device accessibility - compose, read, and manage from any device
  * Decentralized - Easy, lightweight setup on my own server, or Raspberry Pi
  * Federated - this provides:
  * Discoverability - my feed shows up elsewhere, others can follow (ala Mastodon)
  * Interactivity - webmentions, re-sharing, quoting, commenting, etc.
  * GUI - essential for quick and easy posts or admin work
  * Plugins - probably best to keep the core light yet allow for easier customization
  * Theme-ability - same reasons

The current state of things is very centralized/siloed. Medium, Wordpress.com and Tumblr make it easy to discover and interact, but at any moment they can tweak something and the features you love disappear, or you are forced to wade through a deluge of ads, and you can't block bullies, and in the end they kick you off or just disappear altogether. The end user has very little control.

Or you self-host and regain all the control, but lose all the discoverability and interaction. You're on an island.

I've been on [Mastodon][1] for over a year, and for the most part it really has replaced Twitter for me. Facebook is another thing altogeteher. I look forward to the day when I can just dump that behemoth. But for blogging nothing is up and running yet. [Plume][2] looks very promising, but I fail to find anything else out there. Maybe I'm just missing something? If so, please let me know!
