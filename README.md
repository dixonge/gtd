[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7359ff1d-51d5-43b8-b292-b6768376ef45/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/upbeat-banach-f0a709/deploys)

I used the [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) static site generator for this site, as well as [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). NPM packages include:

[postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss)
[postcss-purgecss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-purgecss)
[cssnano](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssnano)
